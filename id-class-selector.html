    I am very interested in the ICT Trainee position at Stromme Foundation, drawn by the opportunity to combine my IT skills with my passion for social impact. With a Bachelor’s in Information Systems and Technology from Makerere University and hands-on experience from an internship at Stratcom Communications and IT Solutions, I have developed practical skills in network management, software troubleshooting, and technical support, which I believe will add value to your team.
